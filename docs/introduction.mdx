<br />

Zap is a free Lightning Network wallet focused on user experience and ease of use, with the overall goal of helping the cryptocurrency community scale Bitcoin.

The UI for Zap is created using
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) + [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/docs).

We have an active [slack]() channel where you can join the discussion on development, design and product.
