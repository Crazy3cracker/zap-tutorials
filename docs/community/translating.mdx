# Translating

Thanks for being willing to translate!

## How to translate

We manage translations using Crowdin.

1. Go to one of our Crowdin projects ([desktop](https://crowdin.com/project/zap-desktop), [iOS](https://crowdin.com/project/zap-ios), [Android](https://crowdin.com/project/zap-android))
2. Select your language
3. Select "app texts"
4. If you don't have a crowdin account, you have to create one now.
5. Translate the missing strings.
6. Celebrate yourself for supporting a free open source project! This step is MANDATORY!

## When will my translation be visible in the app?

Your translation will only be visible in the app after the next release. There is no fixed schedule when updates are happening, so this might take a few days or a few weeks.
