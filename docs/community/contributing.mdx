## How to Contribute

#### Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Zap**, and instead to refer to our [Security Policy](../README.md#security).
- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues][issues].
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one][issues]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting, please read the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) to know more about our coding conventions and practices.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Please join us on [slack][slack] and check [open issues][issues] to see what contributions are needed before tackling a task to avoid duplicate work.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about the Zap source code in [slack][slack].
