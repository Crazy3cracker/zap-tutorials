- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching our GitHub issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one][issues]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting, please read the [Coding Guidelines][covenant] to know more about our coding conventions and practices.
