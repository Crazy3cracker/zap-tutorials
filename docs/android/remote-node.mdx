# Remote Node Setup

You can use Zap Android to connect and control your own LND node. <br />

In case you don't already have an own LND node, you can create one with one of the projects found below.<br />
After your node is setup, you either have to use a displayed QR-Code or a pastable string to finally connect Zap Android to your node.
