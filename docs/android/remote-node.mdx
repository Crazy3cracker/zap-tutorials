# Remote Node Setup for Zap Android

You can use Zap Android to connect and control a remote LND node.

### Step 1: Setting up a remote node

The setup process is identical to a remote node setup with iOS.

Please refer to the one of the following iOS guides for setting up a remote node.

- [Setup with docker](/docs-ios-docker-node-setup)
- [manual setup](/docs-ios-remote-node-setup)

### Step 2: Connect Zap Android with your node

- After starting Zap Android, go to "Setup Wallet".
- Enter a pin to protect your wallet.
- On the following screen choose "Connect to Remote Node".
- Scan the qr-code generated in the iOS guides.

Congrats! You are now able to control your node from your Android phone! Once you have channels open you can start transacting via Lightning!
