# Zap Android


Zap Android is the youngest of all Zap Wallets. It does not yet have all the features Zap Desktop or Zap iOS have.
Right now it can only be used with a remote setup and it is not yet possible to create a wallet on device.

### Setup

To get your Zap Android setup with a remote node, please refer to the [Remote Node Setup](/docs-android-remote-node) guide.

### Get Zap Android

Install from the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zapsolutions.zap

Download Source code: https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-android
