# Zap Android


Zap Android is the youngest of all Zap Wallets. It does not yet have all the features Zap Desktop or Zap iOS have.
Right now it can only be used with a remote setup and it is not yet possible to create a wallet on device.

### Setup

To get Zap Android setup with a remote node, please refer to the [Remote Node Setup](/docs-android-remote-node) guide.

### Features

Here is a quick rundown of Zap Android's features:
- Connect to your own lightning node from anywhere in the world
- Manage multiple wallets
- On or off chain payments
- Show balances in BTC, sats or fiat
- Open or close channels on the go
- Passcode security
- Buildable from [source](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-android)
