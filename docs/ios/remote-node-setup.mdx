# Zap iOS: Remote Node setup with LND Connect tutorial

Yo. We recently open sourced our Zap iOS app along with launching a public alpha. The application currently has on-device LND support toggled off (it is not stable enough quite yet), but we do support connecting to a remote node. In this tutorial I will walk you through how to setup an LND node on a Digital Ocean droplet and connect it to your Zap iOS app in under 10 minutes.

## Create a Digital Ocean Droplet

Once you have a Digital Ocean account create a droplet. Select Ubuntu under "Distributions" and a 1GB memory machine (\$5/month).

</p>

After you click "Create" you should see your new droplet in your Dashboard view.

Once you create a Digital Ocean droplet you can follow this guide [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) to connect to your new droplet via `ssh`.

## Downloading Go

Now that we have a droplet and are connected via ssh, let's download the required dependencies.

First let's ensure we have the latest security updates:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

Next , let's download Go 1.11:

```
$ wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.11.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Next, let's extract the files from the downloaded link:

```
$ sudo tar -xvf go1.11.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Lastly let's move the go folder to `/usr/local`:

```
$ sudo mv go /usr/local
```

## Setup our environment

In order to use Go we have to make sure our `GOPATH`, `GOROOT` and `PATH` environment variables are setup correctly.

First we'll setup `GOROOT`, which is where Go is installed on our machine. For us that's `/usr/local/go`:

```
$ export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
```

Next we'll setup our `GOPATH`. This is the location of our work directory. I will set up a folder at `/~/gocode`, feel free to replace the location/folder with your own preference:

```
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode
```

Lastly we'll setup our `PATH` to access the binary system-wide:

```
$ export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
```

We've only set these environment variables for the current session. If you'd like to make these permanent (recommended but not required) you can edit `~/.profile with nano`:

```
$ nano ~/.profile
```

An example `~/.profile` looks like this:

```
# ~/.profile: executed by Bourne-compatible login shells.
if [ "$BASH" ]; then
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
. ~/.bashrc
fi
fi
mesg n || true
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:/usr/local/bin/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.5.2-beta:$PATH
```

## Verify Go installation

Just to make sure everything went ok we can run `go version` to ensure we have go 1.11 installed:

```
$ go version
go version go1.11 linux/amd64
```

You can verify the environment variables you set with `go env`:

```
$ go env
GOARCH="amd64"
GOBIN=""
GOCACHE="/root/.cache/go-build"
GOEXE=""
GOHOSTARCH="amd64"
GOHOSTOS="linux"
GOOS="linux"
GOPATH="/root/gocode"
GORACE=""
GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
GOTMPDIR=""
GOTOOLDIR="/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64"
GCCGO="gccgo"
CC="gcc"
CXX="g++"
CGO_ENABLED="1"
CGO_CFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_CPPFLAGS=""
CGO_CXXFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_FFLAGS="-g -O2"
CGO_LDFLAGS="-g -O2"
PKG_CONFIG="pkg-config"
GOGCCFLAGS="-fPIC -m64 -pthread -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -fmessage-length=0 -fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build005525529=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches"
```

## Setting up LND ([Source](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md))

First let's install `make`, we will need it to install `LND`:

```
apt install make
```

Run the following commands to install `LND`, `lncli` and all related dependencies:

```
$ wget https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/download/v0.5.2-beta/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.5.2-beta.tar.gz
$ tar xf lnd-linux-amd64-v0.5.2-beta.tar.gz
$ sudo mv ~/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.5.2-beta /usr/local/bin
```

Now we can move into the directory where LND lives:

```
$ cd /usr/local/bin/lnd-linux-amd64-v0.5.2-beta
```

Before we start `LND`, let's start a terminal session via `screen`. Screen allows us to use multiple windows. Enter the following command to start screen:

```
$ screen
```

It will give you some copyright info, helpful text, etc. that looks like this:

```

Simply hit `enter` or `space` to continue.

Now you can decide whether you'd like to run LND paired with your own Bitcoin full node (Bitcoin Core or BTCD) or if you'd like to run LND in its light client mode. To keep things brief this tutorial will use LND in light client mode on testnet. If you'd like to explore other options see [LND's installation guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md).

Get your public IP address so that we can add it to the TLS certificate:

```
wget -qO- ifconfig.co
```

Now let's run the following line to start LND:

```
$ ./lnd --bitcoin.active --bitcoin.testnet --debuglevel=debug --bitcoin.node=neutrino --neutrino.connect=testnet1-btcd.zaphq.io --autopilot.active --rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009 --tlsextraip=<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>
```

The above line starts `LND` on Bitcoin's testnet, signals for light client mode, connects to a couple of full nodes hosted at `zaphq.io`, turns on LND's [autopilot](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/autopilot) feature, and lastly makes sure we are listening for gRPC connections.

After executing the above line you will see your machine prompt you to use `lncli create` or `lncli unlock` to get started. To do so let's detach from our screen session by hitting `ctrl-a d`.

Now enter the following command:

```
./lncli create
```

You will see the following output. Create a password for your wallet and a passphrase for your cipher seed. Then make sure you write down the LND cipher seed you're given:

```
Input wallet password:
Confirm wallet password:

Do you have an existing cipher seed mnemonic you want to use? (Enter y/n): n


Your cipher seed can optionally be encrypted.
Input your passphrase you wish to encrypt it (or press enter to proceed without a cipher seed passphrase):

## LND Connect

While our LND node is syncing let's setup LND Connect. LND Connect is a simple tool to transfer your cert, macaroon and IP to the iOS app for remote connection.

To install LND Connect run the following commands:

```
$ go get -d github.com/LN-Zap/lndconnect
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/LN-Zap/lndconnect
$ make
```

Now simply run `lndconnect` to generate the QRCode we'll scan from our iPhone:

```
$ lndconnect --adminmacaroonpath=/root/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/testnet/admin.macaroon
```

This will generate a QRCode. Depending on your screen size use `cmd +` and `cmd -` to adjust the size of the QRCode:

  />
</p>

## Connecting to our node with Zap iOS

Now for the part we've all been waiting for: using a remote Lightning node from our iPhone.

Now you can select "scan" and scan your LND Connect QRCode. This will populate the app with your cert and macaroon:
<p align='center'>

  <img src="https://imgur.com/OENNiDR.jpg" alt="screenshot" style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }} />
</p>

Verify that the `address` field is populated with your droplet's IP followed by `:10009`. Your IP can be found at your Digital Ocean dashboard:
<p align='center'>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Azx2fzb.png" alt="screenshot" style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }}/>
</p>

Once you've scanned your LND Connect QRCode and you've entered the address field click "Connect". Zap will also remember your connect information so you only have to setup your remote node once. A successful connection will take you into the Zap iOS application:

## Optional: Certificates for remote usage (RaspiBolt tutorial)

The certificates above do not support the LND options `tlsextraip` and `tlsextradomain` that are necessary to connect to the gRPC from a differenct location (eg. used for Zap wallet). Here's how you can create certificates that contain extra ip addresses and domain names.

You can remove and add additional DNS and IP entries, just pay attention to the commas and line breaks.

```
$ sudo su - bitcoin
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out tls.key
$ openssl req -new -sha256 \
            -key tls.key \
            -subj "/CN=localhost/O=lnd" \
            -reqexts SAN \
            -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf \
                <(printf "\n[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=\
                     DNS:localhost,\
                     DNS:YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE,\
                     IP:192.168.0.20,\
                     IP:YOUR_IP_HERE\
                 ")) \
            -out csr.csr
# verify the DNS and IP entries
$ openssl req -in csr.csr -text -noout

$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 36500 \
            -key tls.key \
            -in csr.csr -out tls.cert \
            -extensions SAN \
            -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf \
                <(printf "\n[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=\
                     DNS:localhost,\
                     DNS:YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE,\
                     IP:192.168.0.20,\
                     IP:YOUR_IP_HERE\
                 "))
# verify the DNS and IP entries
$ openssl x509 -in tls.cert -text -noout
```

Copy these new certificates as described above to all locations and restart the lnd service. Now you should be able to connect remotely to your RaspiBolt again.
[here](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) is more information on how to run your own lnd/bitcoin node on a RaspberryPI

## Celebrate 🎊 🍻

This step is absolutely mandatory. You now have a 24/7 online remote Lightning Network node set up with an application to drive it remotely from your iPhone.

Now future versions of the app will have LND running on the device, technical details will be abstracted, it will be tailored towards a mainstream audience, etc. But you don't care. You couldn't wait. You want to experience the future. You want to help push Lightning forward. For that we thank you so much.

A reminder that this application is in alpha stage. Please proceed with caution (very craefully). All bugs or suggested improvements can be reported to our github or communicated directly to us via slack.

Enjoy. Cheers friends.
